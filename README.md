# Plot.ly-BellyButton-Challenge

Hello!
Welcome to my Plotly challenge where I was tasked with building an interactive map(s) to display the data found from the Belly Button Bacteria study. 
In my link below, you will find the dropdown "Test Subject ID" will produce numerous test subject numbers, which will populate the persons Demographics, a bar chart to show each bacteria that was found and how many, along with a bubble chart to quickly see which bacteria was prominant in each subject. 


Here is the link to my interactive map.

As always, 
Thank you for stopping by and I encourage/welcome feedback.
Have a wonderful day!
